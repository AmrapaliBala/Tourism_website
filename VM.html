   Following the death of Queen Victoria in January 1901,it was suggested by Lord Curzon, then-Viceroy of
   India,that a fitting memorial to the late Queen-Empress be created. Lord Curzon proposed the construction
   of a grand building with a museum and gardens.

   Curzon said,

    "Let us, therefore, have a building, stately, spacious, monumental and grand, to which every newcomer 
    in Calcutta will turn, to which all the resident population, European and Native, will flock, where 
    all classes will learn the lessons of history and see revived before their eyes the marvels of the past."

    The Prince of Wales, laid the foundation stone on 4 January 1906, and it was formally opened to the public 
    in 1921.

    In 1912, before the construction of the Victoria Memorial was finished, King George V announced the
    transfer of the capital of India from Kolkata to New Delhi.Thus, the Victoria Memorial was built 
    in what would be a provincial city rather than a capital.

     The Victoria Memorial was mainly funded by British officials and individuals of India.The politicians 
     and  people of India responded generously to Lord Curzon's appeal for funds, and the total cost
     of construction of the monument, amounting to one crore, five lakhs of Rupees (₹), was entirely
     derived from their voluntary subscriptions.

     The construction of the Victoria Memorial was delayed by Curzon's departure from India in 1905 with a 
     subsequent loss of local enthusiasm for the project and the need for testing of the foundations. 
     The Victoria Memorial's foundation stone was set in 1906 and the building opened in 1921.The work of 
      construction was entrusted to Messrs. Martin & Co. of Kolkata. Work on the superstructure began in
      1910. After 1947, some additions were made to the Memorial.

      A smaller Victoria memorial was also constructed in the Hardoi District, which has since been converted
      into a city club for recreation. It is also where Mahatma Gandhi addressed Hardoi in the 1930's.

   The Victoria Memorial's architect was William Emerson (1843–1924).The design is in the Indo-Saracenic revivalist
   style which uses a mixture of British and Mughal elements with Venetian, Egyptian, Deccani architectural
   influences.The building is 338 by 228 feet (103 by 69 m) and rises to a height of 184 feet (56 m). 
   It is constructed of white Makrana marble.</p>
  
  <p>The gardens of the Victoria Memorial were designed by Lord Redesdale and David Prain. Emerson's assistant,
  Vincent Jerome Esch, designed the bridge of the north aspect and the garden gates. In 1902, Emerson engaged
   Esch to sketch his original design for the Victoria Memorial.</p>

   <p>Atop the central dome of the Victoria Memorial is the 16 ft (4.9 m) figure of the Angel of Victory.
   Surrounding the dome are allegorical sculptures including Art, Architecture, Justice, and Charity 
   and above the North Porch are Motherhood, Prudence and Learning.</p>

   <p>The Victoria Memorial is built of white Makrana marble.In design it echoes the Taj Mahal with
   its dome, four subsidiaries, octagonal-domed chattris, high portals, terrace, and domed corner towers.</p>
