   <p><br>The Howrah Bridge is a balanced cantilever bridge over the Hooghly River in West Bengal, India.
    Commissioned in 1943,the bridge was originally named the New Howrah Bridge, because it replaced a 
     pontoon bridge at the same location linking the cities of Howrah and Kolkata (Calcutta). On 14 June 
     1965, it was renamed Rabindra Setu after the great Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore, who was the first
     Indian and Asian Nobel laureate.It is still popularly known as the Howrah Bridge.</p>

      <p>The bridge is one of four on the Hooghly River and is a famous symbol of Kolkata and West Bengal. 
     The other bridges are the Vidyasagar Setu (popularly called the Second Hooghly Bridge), the Vivekananda 
      Setu and the relatively new Nivedita Setu. It weathers the storms of the Bay of Bengal region, 
       carrying a daily traffic of approximately 100,000 vehicles and possibly more than 150,000 pedestrians,
      easily making it the busiest cantilever bridge in the world.The third-longest cantilever bridge at 
      the time of its construction,the Howrah Bridge is currently the sixth-longest bridge of 
     its type in the world.</p></font></center>
