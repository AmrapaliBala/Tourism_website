   <p><br>The Birla Planetarium (officially M. P. Birla Planetarium) in Kolkata, West Bengal, India, 
   is a single-storeyed circular structure designed in the typical Indian style, whose architecture is 
  loosely styled on the Buddhist Stupa at Sanchi.[1] Situated at Chowringhee Road adjacent to the Victoria 
   Memorial, St. Paul's Cathedral and the Maidan in Central Kolkata, it is the largest planetarium in Asia 
  and the second largest planetarium in the world.[3] There are two other Birla Planetariums in

  The new planetarium system for the Birla Planetarium is a so-called ZEISS Hybrid Planetarium, with the
  STARMASTER, an optical-mechanical planetarium projector (also called “Starball”) working in synch with
  a dome video display system. The Starball presents the most realistic starfield in the dome with superimposed
  images of constellation outlines, space objects like nebula and galaxies, planets and moons by the VELVET
  digital video system, called fulldome projection. The technical upgrade was delivered and installed
   by the German company Carl Zeiss AG.</p></font></center>
