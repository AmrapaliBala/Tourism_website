   Kolkata also known as Calcutta,the official name until 2001) is the capital of the Indian state of 
   West Bengal. Located on the eastern bank of the Hooghly River, the city is approximately 80 km (50 mi)
   west of the border with Bangladesh. It is the primary business, commercial, and financial hub of Eastern
   India and the main port of communication for North-East India.According to the 2011 Indian census,
   Kolkata is the seventh-most populous city in India, with a population of 45 lakh (4.5 million) residents
   within the city limits, and a population of over 1.41 crore (14.1 million) residents in the Kolkata
   Metropolitan Area. It is the third-most populous metropolitan area in India. In 2021, Kolkata metropolitan 
   area crossed 1.5 crore (15 million) registered voters. The Port of Kolkata is India's oldest operating port
    and its sole major riverine port. Kolkata is regarded as the Cultural Capital of India.</p>

   <p>In the late 17th century, the three villages that predated Calcutta were ruled by the Nawab of Bengal
   under Mughal suzerainty. After the Nawab granted the East India Company a trading licence in 1690,
  the area was developed by the Company into an increasingly fortified trading post known as Fort William.
   Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah occupied Calcutta in 1756, and the East India Company retook it the following year.
   In 1793 the East India company was strong enough to abolish native rule, and assumed full sovereignty of 
  the region. Under the company rule and later under the British Raj, Calcutta served as the capital of 
  British-held territories in India until 1911. In that year, after assessing its geographical location,
  combined with growing nationalism in Bengal (Calcutta became the centre for the Indian independence movement), 
  the British moved the capital to the relatively more centrally located New Delhi.</p>

  <p>Following independence in 1947, Kolkata, which was once the premier centre of Indian commerce, culture,
  and politics, suffered many decades of political violence and economic stagnation before it rebounded.
  A demographically diverse city, the culture of Kolkata features idiosyncrasies that include distinctively 
 close-knit neighbourhoods (paras) and freestyle conversations (adda). Kolkata is home to eastern India's 
 film industry, known as Tollywood, and cultural institutions, such as the Academy of Fine Arts, 
 the Victoria Memorial, the Asiatic Society, the Indian Museum, and the National Library of India.
  Among scientific institutions, Kolkata hosts the Agri Horticultural Society of India, 
 the Geological Survey of India, the Botanical Survey of India, the Calcutta Mathematical Society, 
 the Indian Science Congress Association, the Zoological Survey of India, the Institution of Engineers,
  the Anthropological Survey of India and the Indian Public Health Association. Four Nobel laureates
  and two Nobel Memorial Prize winners are associated with the city.Though home to major cricketing
  venues and franchises, Kolkata stands out in India for being the country's centre of association
    football and also having strong culture in other sports less widespread elsewhere.</p>

  <font size="3"><b><center>History about Kolkata</b>
    <p>The discovery and archaeological study of Chandraketugarh, 35 km (22 mi) north of Kolkata, provide
    evidence that the region in which the city stands has been inhabited for over two millennia.Kolkata's
    recorded history began in 1690 with the arrival of the English East India Company, which was
    consolidating its trade business in Bengal. Job Charnock, an administrator who worked for the company,
    was formerly credited as the founder of the city;In response to a public petition,the Calcutta 
    High Court ruled in 2003 that the city does not have a founder.The area occupied by the present-day
    city encompassed three villages: Kalikata, Gobindapur and Sutanuti. Kalikata was a fishing village; 
   Sutanuti was a riverside weavers' village. They were part of an estate belonging to the Mughal emperor;
   the jagirdari (a land grant bestowed by a king on his noblemen) taxation rights to the villages were held 
   by the Sabarna Roy Choudhury family of landowners, or zamindars. These rights were transferred to 
    the East India Company in 1698. </p>

    <p>In 1712, the British completed the construction of Fort William, located on the east bank of
     the Hooghly River to protect their trading factory.Facing frequent skirmishes with French forces,
     the British began to upgrade their fortifications in 1756. The Nawab of Bengal, Siraj ud-Daulah,
     condemned the militarisation and tax evasion by the company. His warning went unheeded, and 
     the Nawab attacked; he captured Fort William which led to the killings of several East India
      company officials in the Black Hole of Calcutta.A force of Company soldiers (sepoys)
     and British troops led by Robert Clive recaptured the city the following year.
     Per the 1765 Treaty of Allahabad following the battle of Buxar, East India company 
     was appointed imperial tax collector of the Mughal emperor in the province of Bengal, 
    Bihar and Orissa, while Mughal-appointed Nawabs continued to rule the province.Declared 
     a presidency city, Calcutta became the headquarters of the East India Company by 1773.</p>

    <p>In 1793, ruling power of the Nawabs were abolished and East India company took complete control
    of the city and the province. In the early 19th century, the marshes surrounding the city were drained; 
    the government area was laid out along the banks of the Hooghly River. Richard Wellesley, Governor-General
    of the Presidency of Fort William between 1797 and 1805, was largely responsible for the development 
    of the city and its public architecture.Throughout the late 18th and 19th century, 
    the city was a centre of the East India Company's opium trade.A census in 1837 records the population 
   of the city proper as   229,700, of which the British residents made up only 3,138.The same source
   says another 177,000 resided in the suburbs and neighbouring villages, making the entire population
    of greater Calcutta 406,700.</p>

    <p>In 1864, a typhoon struck the city and killed about 60,000 in Kolkata.</p>

    <p>During the 1960s and 1970s, severe power shortages, strikes and a violent Marxist–Maoist movement 
    by groups known as the Naxalites damaged much of the city's infrastructure, resulting in economic
   stagnation.The Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 led to a massive influx of thousands of refugees, many of 
  them penniless, that strained Kolkata's infrastructure.During the mid-1980s, Mumbai (then called Bombay) overtook
  Kolkata as India's most populous city. In 1985, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi dubbed Kolkata a "dying city" 
  in light of its socio-political woes.In the period 1977–2011, West Bengal was governed from Kolkata 
  by the Left Front, which was dominated by the Communist Party of India (CPM). It was the world's 
 longest-serving democratically elected communist government, during which Kolkata was a key base for Indian
  communism.In the 2011 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, Left Front was defeated by the
  Trinamool Congress. The city's economic recovery gathered momentum after the 1990s, when India began 
 to institute pro-market reforms. Since 2000, the information technology (IT) services sector has revitalised Kolkata's stagnant economy. The city is also experiencing marked growth in its manufacturing base.</p></center></font>

   <font size="3"><center><b>Culture</b>
   <br>
     Kolkata is known for its literary, artistic and revolutionary heritage; as the former capital of India,
    it was the birthplace of modern Indian literary and artistic thought.Kolkata has been called
    the "City of Furious, Creative Energy" as well as the "cultural [or literary] capital of India".
    The presence of paras, which are neighbourhoods that possess a strong sense of community, is 
    characteristic of the city.Typically, each para has its own community club and on occasion, a 
   playing field.Residents engage in addas, or leisurely chats, that often take the form of freestyle i
   ntellectual conversation.The city has a tradition of political graffiti depicting everything
   from outrageous slander to witty banter and limericks, caricatures and propaganda.</p> 

  <p>Kolkata has many buildings adorned with Indo-Islamic and Indo-Saracenic architectural motifs. Several 
  well-maintained major buildings from the colonial period have been declared "heritage structures";
 others are in various stages of decay.Established in 1814 as the nation's oldest museum, the
  Indian Museum  houses large collections that showcase Indian natural history and Indian art.Marble Palace is
   a classic example of a European mansion that was built in the city. The Victoria Memorial, a place of interest
  in Kolkata, has a museum documenting the city's history. The National Library of India is the leading public
   library in the country while Science City is the largest science centre in the Indian subcontinent.</p>

  <p>The popularity of commercial theatres in the city has declined since the 1980s.Group theatres 
  of Kolkata,a cultural  movement that started in the 1940s contrasting with the then-popular commercial 
  theatres, are theatres that are not professional or commercial, and are centres of various experiments 
  in theme, content, and production;group theatres use the proscenium stage to highlight socially 
  relevant messages.Chitpur locality of the city houses multiple production companies of jatra, a 
  tradition of folk drama popular in rural Bengal.Kolkata is the home of the Bengali cinema industry, 
  dubbed "Tollywood" for Tollygunj, where most of the state's film studios are located.Its long tradition of
  art films includes globally acclaimed film directors such as Academy Award-winning director Satyajit Ray, 
  Ritwik Ghatak, Mrinal Sen, Tapan Sinha and contemporary directors such as Aparna Sen, Buddhadeb Dasgupta, 
  Goutam Ghose and Rituparno Ghosh.During the 19th and 20th centuries, Bengali literature was modernised
  through the works of authors such as Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Michael 
  Madhusudan Dutt, Rabindranath Tagore, Kazi Nazrul Islam and Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay.Coupled
  with social reforms led by Ram Mohan Roy, Swami Vivekananda and others, this constituted a major part
 of the Bengal Renaissance.The middle and latter parts of the 20th century witnessed the arrival of
  post-modernism, as well as literary movements such as those espoused by the Kallol movement, 
 hungryalists and the little magazines.Large majority of publishers of the city is concentrated in and around 
  College  Street, "..a half-mile of bookshops and bookstalls spilling over onto the pavement", 
  selling new and used books.</p>

  <p>Kalighat painting originated in 19th century Kolkata as a local style that reflected a variety of themes 
  including mythology and quotidian life.The Government College of Art and Craft, founded in 1864, has been 
  the cradle as well as workplace of eminent artists including Abanindranath Tagore, Jamini Roy and
   Nandalal Bose. The art college was the birthplace of the Bengal school of art that arose as an avant 
  garde and nationalist movement reacting against the prevalent academic art styles in the early 20th century.
  The Academy of Fine Arts and other art galleries hold regular art exhibitions. The city is recognised for
  its appreciation of Rabindra sangeet (songs written by Rabindranath Tagore) and Indian classical music,
  with important concerts and recitals, such as Dover Lane Music Conference, being held throughout the year
  ; Bengali popular music, including baul folk ballads, kirtans and Gajan festival music; and modern music, 
  including Bengali-language adhunik songs.Since the early 1990s, new genres have emerged, including
   one comprising alternative folk–rock Bengali bands.Another new style, jibonmukhi gaan ("songs about life"),
   is based on realism.</p> 

  <p>Key elements of Kolkata's cuisine include rice and a fish curry known as machher jhol,
   which can be accompanied by desserts such as roshogolla, sandesh, and a sweet yoghurt known as mishti dohi.
   Bengal's large repertoire of seafood dishes includes various preparations of ilish, a fish that is a 
  favourite among Calcuttans. Street foods such as beguni (fried battered eggplant slices), 
  kati roll (flatbread roll with vegetable or chicken, mutton or egg stuffing), 
  phuchka (a deep-fried crêpe with tamarind sauce) and Indian Chinese cuisine from Chinatown are popular.</p>

  <p>Though Bengali women traditionally wear the sari, the shalwar kameez and Western attire is gaining
   acceptance among younger women.Western-style dress has greater acceptance among men, 
  although the traditional dhoti and kurta are seen during festivals. Durga Puja, held in September–October, 
  is Kolkata's most important and largest festival; it is an occasion for glamorous celebrations and artistic
  decorations.The Bengali New Year, known as Poila Boishak, as well as the harvest festival of Poush Parbon 
  are among the city's other festivals; also celebrated are Kali Puja, Diwali, Holi, Jagaddhatri Puja, 
  Saraswati Puja, Rathayatra, Janmashtami, Maha Shivratri, Vishwakarma Puja, Lakshmi Puja, Ganesh Chathurthi, 
  Makar Sankranti, Gajan, Kalpataru Day, Bhai Phonta, Maghotsab, Eid, Muharram, Christmas, Buddha Purnima and 
 Mahavir Jayanti. Cultural events include the Rabindra Jayanti, Independence Day (15 August), Republic Day
  (26 January), Kolkata Book Fair, the Dover Lane Music Festival, the Kolkata Film Festival, Nandikar's
   National Theatre Festival, Statesman Vintage & Classic Car Rally and Gandhi Jayanti.</p></center></font>
